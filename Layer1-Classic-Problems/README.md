**Brief Summary of my Layer 1 Report**

This report explores the fundamental resources and concepts of the operating system. Aiming to build a strong foundation and gain deeper understanding on how the operating system works before advancing to more complex systems.

In **Part A**, we discussed process management, comparing process and threads, and describing the different states a process undergoes during execution.

In **Part B**, we continued to memory management, identifying the difference between paging and segmentation, and calculated Effective Memory Access Time (EMAT) with the presence of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).

In **Part C**, we examined CPU scheduling principles by comparing two scheduling algorithms - First Come First Serve and Round Robin. Then created Gantt charts to illustrate their execution.

Lastly, in **Part D**, we explored classic synchronization problems and their solutions. Namely, the Dining Philosophers, the Producer-Consumer (Bounded-Buffer), and the Reader-Writer problems.
